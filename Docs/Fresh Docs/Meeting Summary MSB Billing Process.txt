Meeting Summary: MSB Billing Process Review & Implementation Planning
Meeting Details
Date: July 8, 2025
Time: 13:41:45 CET – 15:27:32 CET
Topic:
The meeting focused on the MSB (Metering Service Billing) process, covering:
The creation and management of MSB contracts
Integration with device management
Handling of price catalogs
Implications of regulatory requirements on billing processes
Setup of billing plans
Handling of supplier responses
Differentiation between MSB and VNB (Distribution System Operator) billing

1. MSB Contract Creation and Supplier Handling
The MSB contract is initiated when a new metering device (MME or IMS) is installed, triggering a master data update.
The supplier has 6 to 8 working days to respond to the billing request:
If the supplier accepts, they assume billing responsibility.
If the supplier rejects, the MSB directly invoices the end customer.
Billing begins immediately after contract creation, regardless of the supplier’s response, requiring close attention from the billing team.
2. Communication and Customer Notification
A welcome letter is sent to the end customer once the MSB contract is active, explaining the billing structure and applicable charges.
An annual invoice follows, depending on the configured billing plan.
3. Billing Plan Setup
Two billing models are available:
Rolling Billing Plan: Starts from the device installation date.
Yearly Billing Plan: Starts from January 1st each year.
Companies must apply one uniform model across all customers.
4. Device Classification and Price Catalog
Devices are categorized (e.g., MME, IMS) and mapped to price classifications, which determine billing rates.
The price catalog contains:
Standard device charges
Additional components like transformer costs
While some prices are defined by the business, most are legally regulated, with fixed upper limits under the Messstellenbetriebsgesetz.
Accuracy in device classification and price mapping is critical; coordination with the device management team is required.
The catalog must be reviewed and validated by the business team for compliance and feasibility.
5. Process Integration and Trigger Mechanisms
MSB contract creation or updates are triggered by:
Device changes
New customer registrations
Master data updates
The system must handle the creation, update, or delimitation of MSB contracts accordingly.
Accurate master data management is essential to ensure billing stability.
6. MSB Billing for VNB
In scenarios involving IMS devices, a portion of the billing is assigned to the VNB (Distribution System Operator).
If MSB and VNB are part of the same company, this internal billing and reconciliation is automated and ensures regulatory compliance.
7. Regulatory Compliance
The billing process must fully comply with the Messstellenbetriebsgesetz and related legal frameworks.
Maximum price limits must not be exceeded.
Faber emphasized the importance of compliance for audit readiness, noting that deviations could lead to auditor objections or regulatory issues.
8. Simulation and Testing
While billing teams do not commonly use simulations, the controlling and technical teams perform them to:
Validate process stability
Identify configuration issues
Ensure invoice accuracy
Bence and Swathika agreed simulations should be conducted before go-live.
9. Clarifications and Open Questions
Supplier Rejections: If a supplier rejects the billing responsibility, the MSB invoices the connection user directly.
Master Data Change Effects: Questions were raised about how new data influences contract updates or terminations.
